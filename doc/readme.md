# Hopr - Hold and Press keyboard shortcuts
A pseudo-chorded keyboard remapper.

## What is it?
Hopr lets the user map certain key sequences, called chords, to other keystrokes. The main goal is reduce stress on the hands and fingers by moving hard to reach keys and key combinations to more central positions. All common keyboard actions such as movement, editing, typing etc can be reached without leaving the home row. For example, some of the mappings in the default configuration are:

* The arrow keys can be accessed by holding `SPACE` and pressing `J,K,L` or `SEMICOLON`. 
* Move up paragraph (`CTRL+UP`) can be accessed by holding `SPACE` and pressing `U`. Similarly for `I,O,P`.
* `V` and `M` are mapped as additional `CTRL` keys. That is, holding `M` and pressing `X` is the same as pressing `CTRL+X`

It works by distinguishing between sequential key presses and hold-and-press key events called chords. For example, during fast normal typing of the characters `AB` the following key events may be created:

    <PRESS A> <PRESS B> <RELEASE A> <RELEASE B>

Note that the `B` key is often pressed before the `A` key is released but `A` is released before `B`

A key stroke is considered a chord if two keys are pressed and the second key is released before the first. For example, pressing and holding B and then pressing and releasing A is detected as a chord and can be mapped to another key stroke:

    <PRESS A> <PRESS B> <RELEASE B> <RELEASE A> -> chord A+B
    
Therefore, typing `SIM` the usual way results in the text `sim` but holding `S` and typing `IM` gives the numbers `81`.

### Default Keybindings
The current default key bindings are here: [kbdlayout.pdf](doc/kbdlayout.pdf)

The keybindings are split into layers named by the activation keys. The default key bindings have two activation keys for each layer, one for the left hand and one for the right. The symbols or actions on the right hand side are activated by holding the activation key on the left hand side. For example, hold D and press J to create a left parenthesis.

It is possible to create chords using only the left or right hand but most combinations would be very unergonomic. 

By default, the `SHIFT, CTRL, ALT` keys are not parsed for chords but all key events are sent directly, unaltered. This allows the keys to be used like normal and prevents some issues with repeated use of `ALT+TAB` or using `SHIFT` during fast typing.

## Status
Hopr is currently in a working Linux-only prototype stage. It works but little effort has been spent on setup, configuration or documentation. The current goal is to:

* Use it and evaluate:
  * If the algorithm works as expected
  * What needs improvement (false-positives etc)
  * If the Hold and Press behaviour becomes natural over time
  * If the keybindings are good enough or need modifications.
* Write a Windows or arduino port so I can use it everywhere.

## Installation

There is no installer or setup yet. You can test it by downloading the source and setting the appropriate permissions. I'm running it on Ubuntu 16.04 so it should work on similar setups.

### Dependencies
The program depends on pyyaml and python evdev 

    apt-get install python-evdev python-yaml

### Quick and Dirty Setup

**Do NOT do this on a multi-user machine or a machine that you do not fully control**

This adds read and write permissions for everyone on all input devices. This is not safe on a multi user machine since any user can read your keyboard input.

Set read and write permissions for all on on `/dev/uinput` and `/dev/input/event*`

    chmod +0006 /dev/input/event*
    chmod +0006 /dev/uinput
   
Then, run the program by executing:

    python <path to installation directory>/hopr/main.py

### Setup with group permissions

This approach gives your own user the right to read and write key events. This is safe unless your user is compromised since a key logger could be installed with your user.

1. Create a group `uinput` and change the group of `/dev/uinput` with a rule in `/etc/udev/rules.d`. See [udev rule](script/misc/91_hopr.rules).
1. Verify that `/dev/input/event*` has group `input`. If not, create a group input and make a udev rule to set the group. See [udev rule](script/misc/91_hopr.rules).
1. Add your own user to groups `input` and `uinput`.


### Setup with hopr user

To avoid giving read and write permissions to your own user, create a new user and follow the steps above to give it the proper permissions. Then run the program as the new user. This is the safest way to run the program since your logged in user does not have the right to read or write keyboard events.

See Â·[create_hopr_user.example](script/misc/create_hopr_user.example) for an example.


## Motivation
The main goal is to avoid repetitive strain for heavy keyboard users by reducing the load on the weakest fingers. The inspiration came from chorded key mappers such as [key-chord](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/KeyChord) for emacs. Many of the chorded the chorded key mappers use a timer to distinguish between chords and normal key strokes. For a fast typist it can be difficult to find the right time interval which is long enough to be usable but short enough not to produce false-positive chords. Instead of using a timer, Hopr relies on the order of press and release events to distinguish between normal key strokes and chords. Strictly speaking, Hopr isn't using chords in the traditional sense since the order of the key press and release events is important. 

### Pros
* Fewer false positives for fast typists than approaches using timers.
* Map common shortcuts such as up-paragraph or delete-word to a single chord. 
* Group layers based on usage such as `SPACE` for movement and editing, `S` for entering numbers.
* Fingers never leave the home row. 
* Reduce stress on the little finger by remapping shift, control, enter etc to the much stronger index finger.
* Map common key combinations such as `CTRL+UP` or `SHIFT+ALT+TAB` to a single key chord. 

### Cons
* Currently, HOLD key events are ignored. Holding a key does not trigger key repeat.
* Both key press and release events are not sent until the key is released. This gives a slight lag which at first makes the keyboard feel sluggish. I got used to it after a while.
* There are still some false-positives. Further testing is needed to see how, when and why they occur. 
* Key event order is not preserved. For example, Press A, Press B, Release A, Release B will be parsed as Press A, Release A, Press B, Release B


### To do

Main items:

* Repeat key functionality
* Windows port
* Docs, setups, testing etc

In the far future:

* Arduino port. Create a box you can plug in between the keyboard and computer.

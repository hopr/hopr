Version 4

Solves the following issues:
* Multiple chord modifiers <x+y> + a
* Merging of modifiers for repeated key presses. Alt+Tab Alt+Tab = Alt+Tab+Tab
* Regular / ignored keys. Shift events are never processed as part of a chord.

Notes:
* Event order is not preserved.
* Hold events are ignored
